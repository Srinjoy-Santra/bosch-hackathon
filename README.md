ML methods applied to running cricket commentary
The lists:
list_other_combined has the combined values of list_otherwise an list_between_overs
we need replace the values of list_other_combined in list_action by a  null so that we can get only the players playing the game
....
No commentaries
Then we can make that into a structured dataset


### To Understand

- list_action= player action  + commentary
- list_other_combined=pure commentary
- list_action - list_other_combined = pure cricket actions
