### About the Codes:
- codexyzClasses.py ==> For Data Preprocessing (Contributor : Dragnotic)
- codexyzClasses2.py ==> For Data Processing (Contributoor : Srinjoy)
- codexyzBowlingAnalysis ==> For Data Analysis on Bowling (contributor : Dragnotic)

### ISSUES
- Unexpected Error: in codexyzclasses2.py (GOD KNOWS WHY? SEEMS PERFECTLY FINE TO ME)
- Required to go through the code and fix the error (idk what)

### UPDATES FROM Srinjoy
- Combined analysis with render to get output html
- Dragnotic is informed the 100th time to remove those unnecessary class features
-- Look at Srinjoy's analysis.py code and try to bring it to the same format to maintain sanity, uniformity and cooperation
